[Link to dataset]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-01/horror_movies.csv")

What I Plan to Investigate:

Most Popular Horror Movie (by popularity and revenue)
If "R" Rated Movies Have any Effect on Watchability 
Types of "Horror" Movie (i.e. horror, thriller, sc/fi, etc.)

Stat 251 Topics:

Working With Strings (separating movies by theme)
Reshaping Data (filtering data)
Dates and Times (using duration of the movie and converting to hour/minute (e.g. 1 hour and 24 minutes))
Visualizing Data (graphing popularity)
